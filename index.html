      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a graduate student in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/complex">CoMPLEX</a> program at UCL, working at the <a href="https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk">Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~pel/">Peter Latham</a> and <a href="http://www.kampff-lab.org/">Adam Kampff</a>. My PhD research is concerned with understanding biological motor learning, by building and analyzing biologically motivated algorithms for learning in recurrent neural networks. I have studied this at the level of synaptic plasticity as well as from the perspective of control theory. More broadly, I am interested in the neural algorithms and representations underlying mammalsâ€™ astounding capacity to learn and adapt in seemingly arbitrary novel environments. To attack such questions, I take inspiration from tools and concepts in machine learning to build mechanistic models of brains and behavior that can hopefully explain experimental findings.

        In my past life, I did my undergrad at Johns Hopkins University, where I majored in Cognitive Science and Classical Guitar Performance. There, I spent four years studying classical guitar under the guidance of maestro Manuel Barrueco, and three years doing research on visual working memory in the <a href="http://www.jhuvisualthinkinglab.com/">Visual Thinking Lab</a> under the supervision of Prof. Jonathan Flombaum and Prof. Gi Yeul Bae.
